E-Learning Website 

This e-learning website provides basic functionality for delivering online courses but has several limitations and areas that require enhancement. The website features a simple structure and minimal interactivity, primarily relying on HTML for layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic elements.

Areas for Improvement
Backend Integration: Adding a backend to store user data, progress, and login credentials securely.
Responsive Design: Improving the layout to ensure it works seamlessly on all devices.
